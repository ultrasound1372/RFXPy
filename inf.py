# infinity test case
# The port seems to differ from the original code here
# the original code will madly clip this string
# while this code seems to ignore the infinity and just produces a normal wave
# unsure of which behavior is desireable at this time
# or how to get this to behave like the original
# that version of PureBasic appears to ignore division by 0 and give inf
# but sign is undetermined, I don't have that version to test with
